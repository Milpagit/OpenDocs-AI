# OpenDocs-AI
An AI-powered project focused on enhancing documentation processes.

## Overview
OpenDocs-AI is a project designed to leverage artificial intelligence for enhancing documentation. It integrates modern web technologies like TypeScript and JavaScript for its user-facing components, alongside robust backend capabilities powered by Java. This setup suggests a comprehensive application aimed at intelligent management and generation of documentation.

## Tech Stack
The core technologies and languages used in OpenDocs-AI are outlined below:

| Technology | Category         | Notes                                             |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| JavaScript | Programming Language | Core language for dynamic web content and logic.  |
| TypeScript | Programming Language | Superset of JavaScript, providing type safety and improved tooling. |
| Java       | Programming Language | Primary language for backend services and application logic. |
| CSS        | Styling Language | Used for styling and presentation of web interfaces. |

## Features
Based on the project name and detected technologies, the following features are reasonably inferred:

*   **AI-driven Documentation Capabilities:** Utilizes artificial intelligence to assist with documentation tasks.
*   **Modern Web Interface:** Developed with JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS for a dynamic user experience.
*   **Robust Backend:** Powered by Java for server-side operations and data processing.

## Prerequisites
To set up and run OpenDocs-AI, you will need the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Required for JavaScript/TypeScript development, dependency management (e.g., npm or Yarn), and running frontend build processes.
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Essential for compiling and running the Java backend components.

## Installation
Since specific build tool configurations (like `package.json` or Maven/Gradle files) were not provided, the following are general installation steps based on the detected technologies:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Milpagit/OpenDocs-AI.git
    cd OpenDocs-AI
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies (if applicable):**
    If the project includes a frontend or other Node.js-based components, navigate to the relevant directory (e.g., `frontend/` or `client/`) and install dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:
    ```bash
    # Example for a Node.js project root or sub-directory
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Build Java components (if applicable):**
    For Java backend components, you would typically compile the source code. If a build system like Maven or Gradle is used (not explicitly specified in the provided data), you might run:
    ```bash
    # Example using Maven (if pom.xml exists)
    # mvn clean install
    # Example using Gradle (if build.gradle exists)
    # gradle build
    ```
    Without a specific build configuration, manual compilation of Java source files might be required.

## Usage
Detailed usage instructions are not available from the provided data. However, based on the technology stack, typical usage might involve:

*   **Starting the Frontend Development Server:**
    If a Node.js-based frontend is present, you would usually start a development server:
    ```bash
    # Example for a Node.js frontend
    # npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```

*   **Running the Java Backend Application:**
    This would typically involve executing a compiled JAR file or starting a server process:
    ```bash
    # Example for a runnable JAR
    # java -jar target/your-app.jar
    ```

## Scripts
No specific scripts (e.g., from a `package.json` file) were provided in the repository data. Please refer to the project's source code for detailed script definitions once available.

## Folder Structure
The folder structure of the repository cannot be inferred from the provided data.
